# Landing Page Project - Abner Vinaja

## Introduction
This repository contains my code for the second project in [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). This project involves building a basic multi-section landing page.
The project uses basic Document Object Model (DOM) methods to add the following functionalities to the page:
- Dynamically build the navigation menu based on the amount of content (sections) on the page.
- Set a section as an active section whenever it is the section currently being viewed.
- Whenever a navigation menu item is clicked, the page should scroll to the appropriate section.

## Notes
This landing page's structure is based off of the landing page components presented by [unbounce's specifications](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-anatomy-of-a-landing-page/).

While all of this project's code and files were developed from scratch, the project takes inspiration from Udacity's [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) for the landing page project.
