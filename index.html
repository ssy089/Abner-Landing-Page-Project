          <h2>Section 1 - Main Headline</h2>
	  <p>According to <a href="https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/the-anatomy-of-a-landing-page/" target="_blank">unbounce</a>,
	     this first section should contain important but concise information about the advertised product or service. Such information
	     should make it clear to the viewer what they will gain from the product or service, and should clearly establish what the viewer
	     should do in order to receive the product or service. Next to this section (or in the header above it), there would be some
	     kind of promotional image, video, or animation for the product/service or for the company.

          <h2>Section 2 - Supporting Headline</h2>
	  <p>This second section should contain information that supplements the information found in the first section. This information can
	     either follow up on where the first section left off, or it can provide completely new information. Any forms can be next to this
	     section, or in any section after it. Also, some type of social proof (customer reviews, testimonials, etc.) can be put below this
	     section to assure the viewer that the product/service is of legitimate high-quality.

	  <h2>Section 3 - Reinforcing/Closing Statement</h2>
          <p>This third section can contain a reinforcing statement or a closing statement. If it is a reinforcing statement, it reminds the
	     viewer of what the page is advertising, while taking into account what the viewer should know from previous sections. If it is
	     a closing statement, it should serve as a final reminder of the advertised product/service, and should urge the viewer
	     to take action to receive the product or service.

	  <p>This section can contain additional information for convincing the viewer to get the product/service. Additionally,
	     a form may be provided in this section if it hasn't been provided already in previous sections. The form
	     may be a button that redirects the viewer to a page for transactions, or it may be a form with text inputs where the
	     reader may enter their information. If the form is the latter option, it must also ensure that the viewer sees and
	     accepts any "Terms and Conditions".
